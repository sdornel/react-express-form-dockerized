# basic-react-express-form

To start the application:
1) Ensure you have npm installed
2) Ensure you have node installed
3) Run docker-compose build
4) Run docker-compose up

If you have docker containers with duplicate names to these containers you will need to remove (or rename) these containers.

This application uses node 14 to demonstrate running a node version that is not the same as the one installed in your system.
